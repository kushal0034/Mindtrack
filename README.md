# MindTrack: Social Media Early Detection of Depression & Anxiety

**MindTrack** is an interactive, research-focused application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). The project aims to identify early signals of depression, anxiety, and cognitive distraction from social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models.

> **Note:**  
> This is an early-stage prototype. Currently, the model is trained for **single social media post analysis only**. Features for analyzing bulk posts (CSV files) and facial images (emotion detection) are under active development.
